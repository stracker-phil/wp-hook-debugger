# WP Hook Debugger

This is a small debugging plugin that aids in solving the following PHP warning:

```
Warning: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be
a valid callback, first array member is not a valid class
name or object in /wp-includes/class-wp-hook.php on line 287
```

This warning is triggered, when a plugin or theme tries to hook into a WordPress action or filter but does not provide a valid callback function. It can be difficult to debug this issue, because the warning only tells us, that *a hook* is invalid, but not *which hook* causes the problem.

After activating this plugin, you will see a list of all WordPress hooks, that have an invalid callback function. This list will also include valid hooks, but it helps you to track down the problematic plugin/hook.
